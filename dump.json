Those ppl are then moved to group 5++. This will tell you if you have to HS out or get in without the raid leader telling you to. (This is usually more relevant on farm when we switch per boss because of targetted looting.)\r\n\r\n[url=http://pastebin.com/a0N0n7sY]2.

Higher red number means increasingly higher chance for the ring to proc very soon (TM). On fights less than 6 mins you want to track as many of these ICDs as possible, so you can delay the use of the 3 min dps cd for when you have multiple procs up at the same time (or they are coming very soon). (Still: don't fool yourself on 7 min fights.)\r\n\r\n[url=http://pastebin.com/tKYU0s2e]Trinket - Darmac's Unstable Talisman[/url]\r\n[url=http://pastebin.com/GpTkdBe7]Trinket - Shards of Nothing[/url]\r\n[url=http://pastebin.com/d2n8z0wn]Trinket - Blackiron Micro Crucible[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://pastebin.com/KT2wSU4y]Lava Burst cast time[/url]\r\nNow that we have all these haste buffs that come on use or with ICD there is a high chance we will get less than 1s cast time for our spammy spell. This tracks the cast time. Change the spell name in the custom display.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Edit:[/u][/b]\r\n8/5\r\nAdded \"Oregorger - Blackrock Barrage - Interrupt warning on correct stack+cast\".\r\n\r\n11/5\r\n\"Combat time - timer\": Fixed it once and for all. Will now load and do and save the char profiles correctly.\r\n\r\n30/6\r\nAdded \"RaidCDs\".\r\nSwitched out \"1. In raid and in g1-4 (Enter [u]Blackrock Foundry[/u]) (Mythic)\" with [u]HfC[/u].\r\nSame with the \"NOT in g1-4\".\r\nSorted all the auras alphabetically.\r\n"

Before we go on and raid together there is something we want you to read and do first.<br /><br /><br /><br />A short resume of our history can be found here:<br /><a href=\"http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/draenor/Vin+la+Cvicek\">http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/draenor/Vin+la+Cvicek</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><font size=\"6\">Your expectations to us</font></strong><br /><br />By accepting this /ginvite you have also accepted the following rules and statements:<br /><br />Raiding with us is optional. There is no rule in the universe that says you HAVE TO raid with us. You are here because you want to.<br /><br />But since we are a group of real people who spend real time and real energy on this we need some rules so this group effort goes more smoothly. If we don&#39;t live up to your expectations you are free to leave at any moment, even if passed trial. It&#39;s your choice.<br /><br />The calendar is filled with future raids. Since we all like to plan ahead of time we accept or decline to what our schedule looks like. Having to decline a raid day happens. We all got some special events some times a year. If you find your IRL time doesn&#39;t strerch far enough to come raid for a certain day or week you decline the calendar events and tell the officers for how long. If you later find out this has to become permanent we have a slacker rank for just this purpose. <br /><br />You can still be in the guild without having to raid. It&#39;s optional after all.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><font size=\"6\">Our expectations to you</font></strong><br /><br />We recently migrated to this server to have an easier time recruiting and then finally get the progression we have planned for so long. We have done big changes within the guild to push us further towards our goal, and we will continue to make changes when we see they will give us an advantage. Now with recruitment we have lots of new ppl, and we all have to adjust to eachothers.<br /><br />So as you can see there is lots happening at once. We are in essence recreating the guild but without losing our old values.<br /><br />Because of this the guild will be changing and progressing in another rate in 2 months than it does today. What you see today won&#39;t be the case in the future. We will be constantly improving and trying out different ppl to see who fits progression better. How fast and how far we will get depends on what each of us are doing, and how hard each of us are pushing. If we happen to invite some lower performing persons to the raid it&#39;s done to give them experience as possible future raiders, make sure we are enough for the 20 person limit for mythic, and to get more looted items out of the bosses who die in heroic mode. They are here to help us out for as long as it can be justified. It&#39;s important that everybody perform their very best at all times so we can get the bosses down smootly even with a variety of players.<br /><br />This is where you come into the picture.<br /><br />When we are close to downing a new mythic boss there is so little extra that is needed from it to go from a wipe to a kill. If we wipe a whole day on a boss the officers then sit down and analyze what went wrong and what can be done better. If you happen to not do your best because &quot;that other guy is slacking so I won&#39;t bother to push my max either&quot; it will look to us as you are a slacker too. We will end up replacing two instead of one.<br /><br />Same goes for when we have farmed a tier for weeks and months and then get a new raid tier on our hands. We will pick those we know will perform well and consistently. Rest will get some fun too, but they have to wait until the bosses are on farm mode.<br /><br />Anyone who makes drama will get the same treatment, but they might get it faster or even demoted. We do not want any kind of drama in this guild. Not even lootwhoring drama! We are gearing up the group so the group can progress further faster, and that means some will get more gear faster than others.<br /><br />The officers have a set rulebook for who gets loot in which order. If you don&#39;t agree you might not fit in with us.<br /><br /><br />Some last points:<br /><ul><li>Don&#39;t die &gt; do everything right &gt; good numbers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bad numbers</li><li>Perform average or better compared to the raid group to keep your raid spot, and continue to find ways to improve.</li><li>If there are more of your class+spec in the guild then only the best will be picked.</li><li>Class stacking might happen too.</li><li>We can help you out if you ask, but we can&#39;t help if you don&#39;t know what to ask for.</li><li>Treat the in-game calendar as your IRL work schedule. The consequences are the same.</li><li>Same goes for how you treat others.</li><li>Ask on TeamSpeak/Mumble if you need info/refreshment on specific fight elements.</li><li>If each and every one of us give a little extra to the group the group will grow pretty fast.</li><li>DPS-whoring on wrong targets at crucial moments will result in a kick if you don&#39;t improve. If you whore like that you single-handedly wipe the group. All by yourself. Gz on that achievement!</li><li>If you disagree with some decisions during raids you still do what you are told to. We can discuss it later if we are in combat. Maybe we were wrong. Maybe you were wrong. But for this group to function we need all to do their jobs, couse it&#39;s almost impossible to analyze what went wrong if everybody did what they randomly wanted to.</li><li>This guild care about solutions. All problems and &quot;problems&quot; will be solved in one way or the other. Or the third.</li></ul><br /><br /><br /><strong><font size=\"6\">Raiding days+hours</font></strong><br /><br />Monday<br />Wednesday<br />Thursday.<br /><br />1900-2230.<br /><br />Be online on the correct character ready for invite and at the instance portal 10 minutes before the calendar says the raid will start.

Before we go on and raid together there is something we want you to read and do first.A short resume of our history can be found here:http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/draenor/Vin+la+CvicekYour expectations to usBy accepting this /ginvite you have also accepted the following rules and statements:Raiding with us is optional. There is no rule in the universe that says you HAVE TO raid with us. You are here because you want to.But since we are a group of real people who spend real time and real energy on this we need some rules so this group effort goes more smoothly. If we don't live up to your expectations you are free to leave at any moment, even if passed trial. It's your choice.The calendar is filled with future raids. Since we all like to plan ahead of time we accept or decline to what our schedule looks like. Having to decline a raid day happens. We all got some special events some times a year. If you find your IRL time doesn't strerch far enough to come raid for a certain day or week you decline the calendar events and tell the officers for how long. If you later find out this has to become permanent we have a slacker rank for just this purpose. You can still be in the guild without having to raid.

There is no rule in the universe that says you HAVE TO raid with us. You are here because you want to.\r\n\r\nBut since we are a group of real people who spend real time and real energy on this we need some rules so this group effort goes more smoothly. If we don't live up to your expectations you are free to leave at any moment, even if passed trial. It's your choice.\r\n\r\nThe calendar is filled with future raids. Since we all like to plan ahead of time we accept or decline to what our schedule looks like. Having to decline a raid day happens. We all got some special events some times a year. If you find your IRL time doesn't strerch far enough to come raid for a certain day or week you decline the calendar events and tell the officers for how long. If you later find out this has to become permanent we have a slacker rank for just this purpose. \r\n\r\nYou can still be in the guild without having to raid. It's optional after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Our expectations to you[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nWe recently migrated to this server to have an easier time recruiting and then finally get the progression we have planned for so long. We have done big changes within the guild to push us further towards our goal, and we will continue to make changes when we see they will give us an advantage. Now with recruitment we have lots of new ppl, and we all have to adjust to eachothers.\r\n\r\nSo as you can see there is lots happening at once. We are in essence recreating the guild but without losing our old values.\r\n\r\nBecause of this the guild will be changing and progressing in another rate in 2 months than it does today. What you see today won't be the case in the future. We will be constantly improving and trying out different ppl to see who fits progression better. How fast and how far we will get depends on what each of us are doing, and how hard each of us are pushing. If we happen to invite some lower performing persons to the raid it's done to give them experience as possible future raiders, make sure we are enough for the 20 person limit for mythic, and to get more looted items out of the bosses who die in heroic mode. They are here to help us out for as long as it can be justified. It's important that everybody perform their very best at all times so we can get the bosses down smootly even with a variety of players.\r\n\r\nThis is where you come into the picture.\r\n\r\nWhen we are close to downing a new mythic boss there is so little extra that is needed from it to go from a wipe to a kill. If we wipe a whole day on a boss the officers then sit down and analyze what went wrong and what can be done better. If you happen to not do your best because \"that other guy is slacking so I won't bother to push my max either\" it will look to us as you are a slacker too. We will end up replacing two instead of one.\r\n\r\nSame goes for when we have farmed a tier for weeks and months and then get a new raid tier on our hands. We will pick those we know will perform well and consistently. Rest will get some fun too, but they have to wait until the bosses are on farm mode.\r\n\r\nAnyone who makes drama will get the same treatment, but they might get it faster or even demoted. We do not want any kind of drama in this guild. Not even lootwhoring drama! We are gearing up the group so the group can progress further faster, and that means some will get more gear faster than others.\r\n\r\nThe officers have a set rulebook for who gets loot in which order. If you don't agree you might not fit in with us.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome last points:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Don't die > do everything right > good numbers >>>>> bad numbers\r\n[*] Perform average or better compared to the raid group to keep your raid spot, and continue to find ways to improve.\r\n[*] If there are more of your class+spec in the guild then only the best will be picked.\r\n[*] Class stacking might happen too.\r\n[*] We can help you out if you ask, but we can't help if you don't know what to ask for.\r\n[*] Treat the in-game calendar as your IRL work schedule. The consequences are the same.\r\n[*] Same goes for how you treat others.\r\n[*] Ask on TeamSpeak/Mumble if you need info/refreshment on specific fight elements.\r\n[*] If each and every one of us give a little extra to the group the group will grow pretty fast.\r\n[*] DPS-whoring on wrong targets at crucial moments will result in a kick if you don't improve. If you whore like that you single-handedly wipe the group. All by yourself. Gz on that achievement!\r\n[*] If you disagree with some decisions during raids you still do what you are told to. We can discuss it later if we are in combat. Maybe we were wrong. Maybe you were wrong. But for this group to function we need all to do their jobs, couse it's almost impossible to analyze what went wrong if everybody did what they randomly wanted to.\r\n[*] This guild care about solutions. All problems and \"problems\" will be solved in one way or the other. Or the third.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Raiding days+hours[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nMonday\r\nWednesday\r\nThursday.\r\n\r\n1900-2230.\r\n\r\nBe online on the correct character ready for invite and at the instance portal 10 minutes before the calendar says the raid will start. We will start clearing trash immediately.\r\n\r\nWe might do alt+social+trial run on some sundays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Mandatory addons[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/client]Curse Client[/url]\r\nUpdate all your addons before raid.\r\nMakes it easier for all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/calendarnotify]CalendarNotify[/url]\r\nCalendarNotify pops up a window every time a new calendar event invite has been created. It also gives a reminder about today's events when you log in (and /reload). Missing calendar invites with this addon is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/rclootcouncil]RCLootCouncil[/url]\r\nRCLootCouncilmakes lootdistribution 100x more easy for both the masterlooter+lootcouncil+those who want loot. You can only get loot from main raids through this addon.\r\n\r\nNo addon = no loot.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2]WeakAuras 2[/url]\r\nWhat we require through WeakAuras is to copy our raid boss warnings and other raid tools. Building help for other spell and cooldown is option, although we highly encourage it since it can give anywhere between 10-50% dps increase.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't used WA before and want to try build helping tools we suggest you watch some basic guides first and try recreate what they showed there. After that try google/twitch up some solutions you might wanna try out. Then we can start become helpful, since now you are more aware about what you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/big-wigs]BigWigs Bossmods[/url]\r\nEarlier there was only DBM. Now it's only BW, but somehow DBM is still around in some ppl's UI folder. BW is far superior in all ways, and the raid leaders get a much easier time when using it. But if someone use DBM there will always be compability problems around patch and upgrade days, and the raid as a whole wastes lots of time every time the DBM'ers have to fiddle with it.\r\n\r\nOn top of this: BW is used by all top guilds and every guild who are trying to do mythic the right way. This means BW always is updated within hours after a hotfix is deployed. DBM has a very shady history on this, where it has taken them 3 weeks to just add a simple planned patch. And this wasn't a single case only...\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bigwigs_voice]http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bigwigs_voice[/url]\r\nSame as VEM.\r\nYou don't have to configure anything. It adds itself to all the bosses. But there might be some boss abilities you want to remove sound warning for so you don't get totally spammed down, like Socretar's Exert Dominance if you aren't an interrupter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/hansgar_and_franzok_assist]Hansgar And Franzok Assist[/url]\r\nSimplifies searing plate, stamper and smart stamper dodging so much it's almost cheating.\r\nWatch this video for setting it up:\r\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK4eNi3zr1I&feature=youtu.be&t=20s]Hans'gar & Franzok Mythic | Using an addon to survive the stamp phase as ranged. - YouTube[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/exorsus-raid-tools]Exorsus Raid Tools[/url]\r\nIt shows which hand is yours in the Kromog handphase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Mandatory WAs[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nInstance dependant. Ask for links in raid chat to easily copy/import them.\r\n\r\nYou can also find something useful here:\r\n[url=http://www.vinlacvicek.com/forum/topic/36/]http://www.vinlacvicek.com/forum/topic/36/[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Preparation for new bosses[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nWhen you prepare for new bosses in a new raid tier you save yourself and the raid for 1h of trial and error and wiping. If you don't prepare for a new boss you will make the whole raid lagg 1h behind. Everybody will remember you for being the one who screwed up the most.\r\n\r\nWhen you find a certain part of a boss encounter you die repeatedly on, and you end up being alone of doing it or one of the few, you should do that boss over and over in LFR+normal mode until you get it right. Experience makes you improve. Dead dps do no dps. And needing a personal healer is 2 raid spots wasted. Abuse WeakAuras to get past these boss abilities faster.\r\n\r\nFatBossTV makes good video guides:\r\n[url=youtube.com/user/FatbossTV]youtube.com/user/FatbossTV[/url]\r\n\r\n2 minute guides (videos get uploaded slower):\r\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/user/losgamingshow/videos]https://www.youtube.com/user/losgamingshow/videos[/url]\r\n\r\nOne page picture guide (whoever is making them):\r\n[url=http://imgur.com/a/N2IP5]http://imgur.com/a/N2IP5[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Communication[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nOnly english and piratespeak in guild chat, raid chat and raid channel on TeamSpeak/Mumble. We even accept weird and bad accents.\r\n\r\nHealers:\r\n/join VLCheal\r\n\r\n\r\nFor raids we use TeamSpeak3 and microphones.\r\n[url=http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads]http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads[/url]\r\n85.236.109.225:10187\r\n\r\nTeamSpeak doesn't auto-adjust ppl's microphones like Mumble does. If someone has low volume you can right click their name in TS, choose \"Change Volume\" and move the bar to +5 to +10 dB depending on their volume. One person might even need +15 dB, while another might need -5 dB.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also have Mumble as backup.\r\n[url=http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php]http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php[/url]\r\nsky.siol.net\r\n64646\r\n\r\nSet up both TS and Mumble just in case, and calibrate microphone in both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Consumables[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nHealing tonic.\r\nDo NOT ask for healthstones. It won't heal enough on mythic.\r\n\r\nOnly best flask, best food and augment runes on progress bosses [i]we are done training on[/i]. 2% wipes can be avoided that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Calendar[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nYou already use the CalendarNotify addon and get notified when the officers create new calendar events which you get invited to.\r\n\r\nAlways answer all of them, and do it asap. The addon will continue to remind you every time you log in and reload UI until you have. If you are unsure for all raids 2 months into the future you can accept them all and change to decline when you know you won't make it. Tentative is awesome for personal use, but for the raid leader it means the same as decline. Never use tentative to hint that you are coming. Talk to the raid leader or officers instead.\r\n\r\nYou can also reply to this thread outside the game about your planned AFK:\r\n[url=http://www.vinlacvicek.com/forum/topic/43/]http://www.vinlacvicek.com/forum/topic/43/[/url]\r\n\r\nThe raid leader needs to plan who to take for each raid, and also in well time before the actual raid day. If you accepted but didn't show up, and also didn't tell the officers in another way, you eventually end up in the unreliable bin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Breaks, afk and brb during raids[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nWe will have one 5 min break when we have raided for about 1,5h and one 10 min break about 1h later.\r\n\r\nIf you need an emergency brb for bathroom or similar do your best to do it right after the boss is dead so you are back with spare time before we start on the next boss.\r\n\r\nAnd remember: it's called emergency. A person who is slacking after bosses is wasting time and energy for the rest of the group, and we will eventually have to replace that person so it won't demoralize the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Looting[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nLooting can be done across the whole raid instance. There is absolutely no reason to wait at the dead boss for the loot.\r\n\r\nClick the correct loot option in the RCLootCouncil window that pops up and start clear the trash.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to get an item on bonus roll after you clicked an upgrade option for the same item that dropped from the boss, /w the loot master (usually Rapiu) to disregard your upgrade click. Same if you change your mind right after you clicked options.\r\n\r\nHaving enchants and gems ready in your bags to immediately use the new item is a massive plus, and doesn't even cost you extra money since it will be used soon anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Loot distribution[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nMain-spec > important off-specs > trials > alts > off-spec > transmog\r\nDPS > healers > tanks\r\n\r\nWe distribute after what the guild and raid group will benefit the most from. There are many parameters involved, but in short we give more and earlier to those who perform best in the group. All will get loot, but those who can get more out of each stat will help the group more, and then make sure the rest will get loot faster too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Streaming while raiding[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nMute TeamSpeak/Mumble.\r\nHide guild chat.\r\nHide raid chat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]/w'ing officers during raids[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nWe encourage everybody to think critically and constructively. We also welcome good suggestions.\r\n\r\nDuring raids there is lots going on in the background that the members don't see or hear. The raid leader(s) can be extremely busy throughout the whole raid duration, and might not have time to /w about all and everything. One of the raid leader's main tasks is to make sure the raid goes as efficient as possible, so if you have good and important suggestions you can go on and /w. Otherwise try ask one of the other officers or wait until after raid. We can always do a fast meeting after raid with you and all the officers and listen to what you have to say, analyze, dissect, conclude, find a solution, and set it to life swiftly if it would work.\r\n\r\nIf you have some good ideas on new bosses we can discuss them on TS/Mumble when the first boss tries have calmed down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]Very short summary[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nAll that is written here is something we all have been complaining about throughout our years of raiding.\r\n\r\nWe now write these as \"rules\" and \"employment contract\" so that we can finally get rid of those annoying issues.\r\n\r\nFor all who are raiding with their common sense intact are already covering most, if not all, that is written here.\r\n\r\nAll guilds who are trying to do serious raiding have all the same rules, but they aren't that often written down, and often lead to confusion about what is expected. We want to be more open and direct about what we want and have less unspoken rules that can be randomly broken, and you will have less to worry about.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe care very much for you all no matter what we ask for or what you say! We all just express it in different ways."

I'm always focus during progress and I like to fight against bosses with new tactics such as Thogar which stays my favourite boss for this patch.\n\n[b]Combatlog links:[/b]\nI don't have many logs because of the number of bosses I have done with this character.\n[url=https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/character/9455713/latest#bracket=3&boss=1694]Darmac[/url]\n[url=https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/character/9455713/latest#bracket=3&boss=1696]Orrgorger[/url]\nOne on Fire spec, one on Arcane Spec.\n\n[b]Screenshot of your UI while raiding:[/b]\n[url=http://i.imgur.com/Mkx4YOu.jpg]http://i.imgur.com/Mkx4YOu.jpg[/url]\n\n[b]Which important addons and WAs do you use?[/b]\nBig Wigs, Combustion Helper and some WA such as the one to see which raid buffs are used such as Amplify magic)\n\n[b]Which macros do you use?[/b]\n[b]Which keybinds do you use?[/b]\nYou will see it on my UI.\nI have 25-30 keybinds.

I am a calm person and usually don't tilt. I am prepared to give a 100% from the first minute to last until the raid leader calls it a night. I find farm raids important since it helps everybody get their missing items which helps the guild in the long run.\n\n[color=\"green\"]Combatlog links:[/color]\nI've been restoration for most of WoD so I don't have any relevant feral combatlogs. If you are interested I can try to find my restoration combat logs from mythic oregorger progression.\n\n[color=\"green\"]Screenshot of your UI while raiding (use [url=www.imgur.com]Imgur[/url]):[/color]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qYmldkg.jpg\nI know it looks clunky but that's how I had it for almost 2 years and got used to it.\n[color=\"green\"]Which important addons and WAs do you use?[/color]\nFor Raiding:Deadly Boss Mods, Bartender 4, OmniCC, Skada, TargetHealthPercent,Thogar assists\nMy last weak auras profile got deleted so I have to make a new one. but I will soon add weak auras to the list.\n[color=\"green\"]Which macros do you use?[/color]\nI use my useform/cancelform macros, my cooldown burst macro on all boss fights. I usually make new macros for bosses where it is necessary.\n[color=\"green\"]Which keybinds do you use?[/color]\nI have my core rotation and cooldowns keybinded. Some things I don't use keybinds for: buffs,normal revive(Not CR) and abilities which are extremely situational.\nI use logitech G600\n[color=\"green\"]Explain your talent and glyph choices and alternatives:[/color]\nDisplacer Beast - Helps to stick on the target and also serves as a blink to get out of danger.\nYsera's Gift - Outheals the other two options plus it's a passive.\nmass Entanglement- very situational tier, going to change it if it proves useful to a boss fight\nIncarnation: King of the Jungle - Strongest pick damage wise. Soul of the forest is passive but clearly a DPS loss.\nUrsol's Vortex - Again a situational tier but ursol vortexs is in most cases the most useful one\nDream of Cenarius - Since I use Blood Talons healing wave is a part of my rotation so Dream of Cenarius clearly enhances the healing of the ability and let's me control who am I about to heal.\nBlood talons -Strongest pick out of the 3. While Lunar inspiration may be a tiny DPs increase in \"council\"  fights, blood talons also increases your survivability by making healing touch a high priority spell.\nGlyphs:\nGlyph of cat - It's a base 20% healing taken increase. Very solid.\nGlyph of Savage Roar - the only glpyh which is a DPs increase. Allows me to get a free savage roar at the beginning of the fight\nGlyph of Rebirth - My combat ress now ressurects the person with 100% health.\n\n[color=\"green\"]How do you check what your dps is like?[/color]\nI generally use SKADA as my DPS meter.\n[color=\"green\"]Where do you find new info about your class?[/color]\nIcy veins has basic guides, but from time to time there are great indepth posts on the official forums.\n\n[color=\"green\"]If you have geared alts, at which lvl can you play them?[/color]\nI have a ~680 IL enhancement shaman. I can play him but I don't like the current state of enhancement shamans in PVE.\n\n[color=\"green\"]Do you know anyone from the guild?[/color]\nNot yet but I hope to get to know some great people ;)\n[b][size=5]Why should we pick you?[/size][/b]\nI am free from school for the next 3 months which allows me to dedicate my time to raiding. I am prepared to take the extra step to be competitive and help the guild as a whole. I am a calm person and always try to stay out of drama. I also accept criticism and always try to improve. I have good knowledge of many specs. I am also a social person and quickly get used to people. I also have a lot of experience as restoration and am ok with going resto if you might lack a healer one night.\n[b][size=5]Previous guilds[/size][/b]\n\n[color=\"green\"]Which guilds and roles?[/color]\nHabits - Evade\nAfter Habits split I have been a founding member and healing officer of Evade.\n[b][size=5]Anything else you wanna add?[/size][/b]\nI know I might be a gamble since I haven't done a lot of raiding as feral in this expansions, but I've always played feral and don't think it will take a lot of time to get on a competitive level. I hope you take me into consideration."

Dot told him to check out Shus' enchants but Killovolt replied \" i am checking guides, not shus sry\".\r\n\r\n\r\nKillovolt obviously is too stuck in his elitist mind. He lives in a bubble which has no room for others, and he doesn't look outside to verify how he performs.\r\n\r\nWe have to remind him about his performance and that it isn't helping his trial period.
